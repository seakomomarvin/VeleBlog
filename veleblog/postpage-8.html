<h2 class="sub-heading">The future of Ghana's current Black-Stars squad</h2>
<p class="post-text">Former Black-Stars defender, Shilla Illiasu is optimistic about the current Black-Stars squad due to their spectacular performances in their recent games. According to him, the Ghana squad which is dominated by the talented young players has a bright future and are assured of making the country proud.</p>
<p class="post-text">On class Sports, Shilla Illiasu said that "I think first if all Ghana has one of the youngest squads as far as Quatar 2022 is concerned. What it means is that as far as the future is concerned, we are up there". He also added, "What we need is - I made it clear from the onset, we need someone to be a coach, not a part-time coach, someone to guide the players for the next 3-4 years, give him project, give him time and give him plan, let him understand the task at hand, that's what we need.</p>
<p class="post-text">In Shilla Illiasu view, he says Coach Otto Addo lacks commitment and did'nt help the Black-Stars during 2022 FIFA World cup. "Otto Addo was not that person, he was more than a part-time coach. He had one leg in Ghana, one in Germany Borussia Dortmund and it was difficult to concentrate on the black-stars", he argued.</p>
<p class="post-text">Ghana at the 2022 FIFA World Cup only exited at the end of the group stage. Two defeats against Portugual and Uraguay and  win against South Korea was not enough to send Ghana to the Knockout stage of the Quatar tournament.  </p>
